# Design-and-control-of-two-wheel-line-following-robot
Designed and controlled a Turtle 2WD mobile platform using Arduino-Uno. Implemented a control algorithm for smooth steering of robot wheels along the defined path.  The digital outputs from the QTR reflectance sensor was used to program a control logic and commands were fed to the robot to follow the path accurately.
